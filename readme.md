### Thoughts
- I think while writing this, the deeper I got into it, the more I wished I didn't write it the way that I did. I will go back to this again in the future since this is a really useful project to use when learning web development, but as of right now I would rather not look at what I wrote. 

- About 1-2 days ago I realized that I could have expanded upon my class instructions in order to add methods for Lists() that would { addList(), removeList(), addItem() }. This would cover my edge cases I reckon, and items would have a method inside of them to edit themselves.

- Drawing the DOM in the way that I want to is really difficult, and I think that is solved once again by better structuring my drawing functions into their own files and having EventListeners to call based on the state of the html elements.

- I am still proud of myself for what I was able to learn and accomplish through this project however, even though my writing style makes me sound like I hate the world. I learned:
* how to use localStorage
* how to create data structures using classes 
* how to write to localStorage
* how to read back into browser storage and re-create the original json structure onload.

- Literally once I got into the DOM I starting vomiting spaghetti all over my keyboard. The logic itself is more than functional, and expanding upon itself is easy.

- Once again, this will lay dormant until I eventually rewrite this into something I am actually proud of. As of right now, I am really mentally blocked.
